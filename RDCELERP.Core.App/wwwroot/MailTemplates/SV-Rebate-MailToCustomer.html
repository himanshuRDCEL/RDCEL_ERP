    <p>Hi demoCustomerName,<br>
        Greetings of the day !!</p>

    <p>This is to bring to your notice that the Solar rebate program is still open for the Month of demoCurrentMonth. Please make sure you are ready with the scanned document as below to apply on time due to the very high demand.</p>

    <p>The costing of your Solar PV System with the system size of <strong>demoSystemSize is $ demoSystemPrice Incl. GST.</strong> The Solar Victoria rebate will be applicable on the above amount i.e ($ demoSystemPrice - $ (demoSVRebate + demoLoan) ) and your out of pocket is $ demoFinalAmount after approval.</p>

    <p>To ensure customer applications remain secure and to prevent these from being submitted by third parties, Solar Victoria has introduced a one-time passcode feature, which consists of a unique code sent via SMS to the customerâ€™s phone. This verification happens at the start of the application.</p>

    <p>Below is the list of documents which you need to keep ready:</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Council rates notice, the yearly one</li>
    
        <li>Notice of assessment: Any 1 from the previous 2 years <br>
        
            (You will be required to put up a notice of assessment for all those whose names are mentioned in the council rate notice. For eg, if both husband and wife's name is mentioned in the council rate notice, we will need notice of assessment for both husband and wife)
        </li>
    
        <li>2 forms of Photo id: i.e. drivers license and passport or Medicare.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>P.s. Simply opening the draft and saving it will not put your application in a queue and doing that might result in
        your application being prolonged to the next month.</p>

    <p>The below 3 questions needs to be answered respectively on the Solar Victoria portal</p>

    <ol type="1">
        <li>Who is your solar Retailer: Do Solar Pvt. Ltd.</li>
    
        <li>What is your Quote Number: </li>
    
        <li>Total Quote Amount: $ (System Price)</li>
    
    </ol>

    <p>(P.s. the total quote amount is the amount which includes the STC rebate)</p>
